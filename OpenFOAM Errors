ERRORS in OpenFOAM and ways to rectify it:
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. "Face 747 specified in set f2 is not an external face of the mesh.
This application can only repatch existing boundary faces."

SOLUTION: Make sure the xlimits in the setSet.faces_amont_aval exactly envelopes the face of the boundary and not more.

EXAMPLE: 	//amont_bas
		faceSet f0 new
		faceSet f0 add boxToFace ( -0.01 0.0 0.0 )( 0.01 0.635 0.3175 )
